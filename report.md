# Report

Instead of a midterm and final exam, you will write a report. Think of it as a take home with several deadlines throughout the semester plus a final project.

- Part 1 (12x3=36 points): Homework.
- Part 2 (64 points): Final project.

A template for your LaTeX source file [`report.tex`](report/report.tex) and the compiled [pdf](report/report.pdf). See also [`latex-example.tex`](report/latex-example.tex) and [`latex-example.pdf`](report/latex-example.pdf).

- You will keep both report.tex and report.pdf in your private github repository. 
- In your repo, make a subdirectory `src` where you store the program files  (if a homework requires programming). Call them `hwn.ext` where `n` is the number of the homework/week and `ext` is the extension appropriate for the programming language.
- Always use the same repository for all submissions of the course (get in touch if you want to make an exception).
- Give me access to your private github repo by inviting me as a collaborator (my GitHub name is alexhkurz).
- Submission info below.

**Deadlines:**
- Weekly deadlines for Part 1. Each week has 2 points upon completion.  The remaining points are awarded after the final deadline in December. You are expected to improve upon your weekly submissions for the final report.
- Deadline is the Sunday at midnight. This gives me time to look over your answers on Monday. I will discuss the questions Tuesday in class and you will have an opportunity to improve your answers. (The following is preliminary, we may have to adapt it as we go along.)
    - Week 1: Writing a report in LaTeX (`gcd`).
    - Week 2: Writing recursive programs in Haskell (`member`, etc).
    - Week 3: Executing recursive programs pen and paper (`hanoi`).
    - Week 4: Parsing arithmetic expressions pen-and-paper (concrete and abstract syntax trees).
    - Week 5: Syntax and Semantics of lambda calculus.
    - Week 6: Evaluating lambda terms.
    - Week 7: Free and bound variables. Confluence, termination and unique normal forms.
    - More to come: Transitive Closure and Equivalence Relations. Fixed point combinator. Theorem Proving. Hoare Logic.

- Part 2 
    - A specification of your project was due on the last day of September, but will be postponed until after the deadline of Assignment 1.
    - A prototype implementation (or the core section of a theoretical report) is due on the last day of October.
    - A draft of Part 2 is due on Sunday before the Thanksgiving break.

- The full report is due on the Sunday of the examination week. 

**Submission:**  After completing the homework, each weak, **submit the URL of your github repo** (containing report.tex and report.pdf) **via Canvas** before the deadline. Make sure that you share access to your private repo with me (alexhkurz is my github name).

Do not keep different copies of your report in the repo. I will use git to verify timestamps and git's version control if I need to go back to an earlier version.

## Grading Guidelines

- **D:** Demonstrates adequate understanding of the material, with possibly some missed deadlines and some wrong solutions. No project.
- **C:** Demonstrates *good* understanding of the material. No missed deadlines. Correct solutions to the homework. A straightforward project.
- **B:** Demonstrates *very good* understanding of the material. No missed deadlines. Correct solutions to the homework. The project explores a topic related to this course and shows that the student deepened their understanding significantly.
- **A:** As for B. Moreover, the student is able to apply the concepts of this course to a challenging problem or project showing strong problem solving skills .

A way to describe when a report gets the full 100 points: You would be proud to add it to your resume and I would be proud to show it to my colleagues bragging about how good our students are.

Some further considerations:

- Spelling, typesetting, layout, and structure will also be taken into account for grading. Does the form support the understanding of (or does it distract from) the content? 
- As usual, for full points I need to be able to see a trail of your work on git. 

## Example Project Topics

I don't want to limit your creativity, so please get in touch if you have your own ideas. For example, in the past, I had projects that brouught in creative writing or graphic design.

### Data Analysis

- Github, Stackoverflow, Reddit and other places have an enormous amount of publicly available data. If you have experience with data analysis, you can use it to learn more about how programming languages are used. For example, look at [GitHut](https://githut.info/) and  [GHArchive](https://www.gharchive.org/). 
  - Is it possible to extract data about users moving from one language into another language? 
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Is it possible to use natural language processing (sentiment analysis, etc) to learn what programmers think of languages from forums such as Reddit? 
    - Stackexchange has forums for most important languages. Can on use NLP to make interesting comparisons between two chosen languages?

### Programming

- A software project related to this course:
  - Write a package that allows us to benchmark programs in different programming languages and graph the results for comparison. (Doesn't need to be developed in Haskell.)
  - Developing software tools for the analysis of string rewriting systems.
- **Writing an Interpreter**
  - Implement an interpreter for some programming language. You can take inspiration from [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) and make your own.
  - Write **an interpreter for LISP**. LISP is the first functional programming language that became widely used. It was designed to be as simple as possible (an interpreter can be written in less than a dozen equations), introduced many fundamental concepts to programming languages (such as abstract syntax), and today is still in use and influencing the design of new programming languages.
  - Develop a domain specific language (DSL).
<!-- Learn a new programming paradigm. Logic programming, infinite lists, reactive programming, probabilistic programming, blockchain, etc-->
- **Learn a new programming language**, write a tutorial and implement an interesting project. Make sure you give this project an angle that makes it interesting from the point of *Programming Languages* (note the plural). To explain bettter what I mean:
  - Include some of the history of the programming language. Try to find out something about the design decisions that went into the language. What was the motivation behind the language? Find interviews, articles, podcasts, etc in which the designers of the language talk about some of this background.
  - How was the language received? How did it develop? Is it used today for what it was designed for? How did its usage change over time?  
  - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the language? How does the language compare to other langauges?
  - Use the software project you develop to highlight some of the questions above.
- Programming with infinite lists in Haskell. **Stream programming** has many applications and the fact that Haskell is lazy allows for elegant stream programming.- **Probabilistic Programming Languages**. The topic of probabilistic Programming Languages should appeal to students with an interest in machine learning and data analysis. Probabilistic programming languages are a new development and I have not looked at them myself yet, so that should be an interesting topic. Here are some links to explore:  
https://bitbucket.org/lazyppl/lazyppl-src/src/master/README.md and https://lazyppl.bitbucket.io/  
https://www.gen.dev/  
https://mc-stan.org/  
https://probmods.org/  
http://pyro.ai/  
https://turing.ml/stable/
- **Programming and Verification**: [Dafny](https://dafny.org/) is a language that allows programmers to insert assertions in the code and have them automatically verified by the compiler.
- **Functional programming and finance**. I just came across https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/simon-peyton-jones/contracts.pdf  ... this looks very interesting to me and could be a starting point to a project.
- **Solidity** is the programming language of *NFTs, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts*, etc. I have been working with students on this topic over summer and we produced a tutorial ... let me know if you find this useful. This is also under development and we'd be happy for anybody to contribute. https://github.com/alexhkurz/SmartContracts/blob/main/Tutorial/README.md  
- **Comparing Programming Languages for Difficulty**. I found two recent articles on methodology to measure "ease of learning" or "learnability" of natural languages. To develop some ideas of how to apply this to programming languages could be **very** interesting. (Should appeal to students with an interest in machine learning, data science and/or linguistics.)
    - [Ease of Learning Explains Semantic Universals](https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/zM5ZGIxM/EaseLearning.pdf), 2020. "we propose a unified cognitive explanation of linguistic universals by measuring complexity in terms of learnability" ... "To operationalize the difficulty of learning, we use off-the-shelf computational tools: neural network architectures currently in widespread use in deep learning" ... "the main claim of the paper that linguistic universals reflect simplicity as measured by ease of learning"
    - [Complexity/informativeness trade-off in the domain of indefinite pronouns](https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/DNmNDAxN/Denic-et-al-Indefinites-SALT.pdf), 2020. "We measure the complexity of an item c(i) as the number of features in its featural make-up. Our measure of complexity of a language Comp(L) is defined as the sum of complexity measures of each item in the language" ... "Our measure of informativeness corresponds to the probability that the communication will be successful given"

### Theory 

(may appeal to math majors)

- A theorem proving project: 
    - (Program Verification) Along the lines of Chapter 2 and 3 of the book [Concrete Semantics](http://concrete-semantics.org/).
    - (Mathematics) Group theory in the Lean mathlib library is quite advanced at this point. So the standard results that we cover in Math 380 (Lagrange’s theorem, Cayley’s theorem, the isomorphism theorems have been formalized), but it would be interesting to find these results in the Lean3 mathlib and try to redo them in Lean4 (since the porting of mathlib from Lean3 to Lean4 is still quite a ways off in the future). To get started on this check out https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html and https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html and install both versions of Lean. 
- Exploring Hoare logic in more depth.
- A math project that explores the category theoretic foundations of programming languages. 
- A project on computability and/or complexity: halting problem, Turing completeness, Church-Turing thesis, etc.
- Applying the methods of the class to problems in the book Goedel, Escher, Bach. Writing a dialogue in the spirit of GEB.
- Typeinference in lambda calculus, natural deduction, Curry-Howard correspondence.

## Writing Tips

- Make sure that you use technical language correctly.  
- Typeset code different from text.
- Do not always go with the first reference that comes up, try to find interesting references for each topic. Cite your references throughout the text.
- In case of doubt, put rather more references. The basic idea of scientific writing is that all claims must be justified. (Of course, every community has its common knowledge.) 
- In Latex, you can use  `\href` to link to online material.

The report is not an English assignment, but I find this classic and entertaining [advice by George Orwell](https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit) useful. 
- To avoid what Orwell calls "this mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence" is particularly important in technical writing. "A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?" Metaphors play a lesser role in our kind of technical writing (despite still being important and deserving attention), but if you replace "image" above by "example", Orwell's remarks are again exactly to the point.
- Orwell recommends to avoid writing something just because it sounds good. Instead, 
    - "put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures". (Again, you can give Orwell's words an interesting twist if you replade "pictures" by "examples".)
    - first "think wordlessly, and then, [...] describe the thing you have been visualising".
