--------------------
-- `inbetween n left right` take a list that looks like "left->right->..." and changes it to "left->[n,*]->right->..."
--------------------

-- this works
val inbetween1 = \n.\left.\right.
    let val between = new [] in
    between := [n,right]; -- between := cons n right
    left := !(cons (hd left) between);
    left;;

-- this is the same 
val inbetween2 = \n.\left.\right.
    let val between = cons n right in
    left := !(cons (hd left) between);
    left;;

-- this is the same 
val inbetweenA = \n.\left.\right.
    left := !(cons (hd left) (cons n right));
    left;;

-- this is slightly different
val inbetweenB = \n.\left.\right.
    (cons (hd left) (cons n right));;

-- WRONG: this creates a strange loop
val inbetweenZ = \n.\left.\right.
    let val between = new [] in
    between := [n,right]; -- between := cons n right
    tl(left) := !between;
    left;;

-- WRONG: this behaves the same as inbetweenZ ... why does it create a loop?
val inbetweenY = \n.\left.\right.
    tl left := [n, right];
    left;;

-- this works ... it is similar to the inbetweenY, but creates a new link
val inbetweenC = \n.\left.\right.
    let val newLink = new [] in
    newLink := !right;
    tl left  := [n, newLink];
    left;;

-- this is similar, with one parameter less
val inAfter = \n.\list.
    let val newLink = new [] in
    newLink := !(tl list);
    tl list := [n, newLink];
    list;;

-- EXERCISE: Compare the behaviour and "memory footprint" of inbetweenA, inbetweenB, inbetweenC. Do they implement the same algorithm?
